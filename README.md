# Canvas Animation Â· SwiftUI Experiment ðŸŽ¨

An exploration of motion and light â€” built entirely with `SwiftUI Canvas`.  
Each frame is rendered in real time, without Metal or external frameworks.

Thousands of animated particles respond to invisible rules of order and chaos,  
assembling into a portrait â€” and dissolving back into space.

Tap the screen to assemble or scatter the portrait.
