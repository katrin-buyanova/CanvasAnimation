# Canvas Animation · SwiftUI Experiment 🎨

An exploration of motion and light — built entirely with `SwiftUI Canvas`.  
Each frame is rendered in real time, without Metal or external frameworks.

Thousands of animated particles respond to invisible rules of order and chaos,  
assembling into a portrait — and dissolving back into space.

Tap the screen to assemble or scatter the portrait.
